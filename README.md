## Hi ðŸ‘‹
I am an early career research scientist with experience in creating and analyzing various data types. I have effectively presented findings to diverse audiences through multiple [presentations](https://github.com/ssnajme/Presentations-Collection). I aim to leverage my analytical expertise in an academic data science and machine learning role, continually enhancing my skills through projects and contributions to platforms such as [Kaggle](https://github.com/ssnajme/kaggle-notebooks) and the open-source communities.
